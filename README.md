# Thesis code

Most of the code I used for my PhD work.

The thesis manuscript is available at: https://github.com/jgrizou/thesis_manuscript/releases/download/final/thesis.pdf
The source of the manuscript are available at: https://github.com/jgrizou/thesis_manuscript

The datasets are about 750Mo which may take long time to download. If you are just looking at a tutorial, the best thing to do is to clone only the [lfui](https://github.com/jgrizou/lfui.git) repository, and follow the instruction given there.
